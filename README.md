## VidaSana V2 - Frontend

Initially, the project began with plain HTML and JavaScript, developed by a team specializing in technological solutions for businesses. This is the second version, where the design team provided an updated design created in Figma. My role was to translate this design into a fully functional frontend using a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) template and [React](https://react.dev/) components, as required by the team.

This is a  project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
